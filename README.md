# Pop the Bubbles

Live: https://erikwithuhk.github.io/pop-the-bubbles/

In Pop the Bubbles, you have 30 seconds to pop as many of the hundreds of
floating bubbles as you can. Popping small bubbles earn you higher points
than popping the large ones, and the bubbles periodically change size as
they float across the screen.
